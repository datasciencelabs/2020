```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
library(lubridate)
```

### Question 1
How do I make the following strings dates?
```{r}
dates <- c("09-03-12", "12-4-9", "0610, 03", "Made on 27 6 1920")

```

### Question 2
Create a data frame with columns `clean_dates`, `month`, `day` and `year`.

```{r}

```

### Question 3
Join the data frame you just created with the one below using `full_join`. Are there any missing values? 
```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(year = c(2003, 2009, 2012, 2016),
										 age = c(17, 23, 26, 30))

```
